The Girl and The Robot is without a single piece of dialogue, instead preferring to tell its story through entirely visual means. Sometimes this works, particularly in the last levels of the game but for the most part the story is without any real depth. A girl is locked in a tower, escapes, befriends a robot and together they try to stop an evil witch. It’s not exactly the most original story and serves little more than to string each level together but I feel that the ending deserves attention for being something completely unexpected. Ultimately the game is too short and the story remains unfinished with an ominous “To be continued,” at the end of the credits. I for one, am excited to see what happens next.
