The random nature of <i style="font-size: 14.6667px; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: transparent;">No Man’s Sky </i>means there’s a lot of fluctuation in quality, but beauty can be found on almost any planet.</span><p><font color="#000000" face="Arial"><span style="font-size: 14.6667px; white-space: pre-wrap;"><br></span></font></p><p><font color="#000000" face="Arial"><span style="font-size: 14.6667px; white-space: pre-wrap;"><br></span></font><br><p style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;" dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 14.6667px; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: transparent;">A colour theory system programmed into the game means that every new planet is like stepping into a painting - but the painter isn’t always very good. The developers extensively used complementary colours to make worlds seem more alien, but their success in this experiment does not always make for visually appealing planets. Solar systems where space is entirely bright pink not only make flying around painful, they also permanently tint the sky of every planet within that system. And while finding dry red desert planets with purple skies is pretty cool at first, it makes for a terrible starting planet where it could take an hour to be able to leave.</span></p><p style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;" dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 14.6667px; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: transparent;"><br></span></p><p style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;" dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 14.6667px; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: transparent;"><br></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 14.6667px; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: transparent;">Similarly, fauna and flora are procedurally generated to mixed results. Most animals are fairly unique, and at the very least look decent. Many of them are extremely cute, and behave adorably as well. But the same few types of plants seem to appear on every second planet with minimal changes, and entirely new plants are rare. However, they have succeeded in making both fauna and flora fit well with their planet’s visual style, giving each planet a lot of character.</span></p></p>
