<span style="font-size: 14.6667px; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: transparent;">My experience on the planet Terribleplanet is a great summary of everything that’s wrong with <i style="font-size: 14.6667px; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: transparent;">No Man’s Sky</i>: the planet was radioactive, the sentinels were crazed, the minerals were sparse, and the land was a dull grey. To make matters worse, I had to sit out an entire storm in my ship because there was no shelter around for ages in that desolate dirt desert.</span><p><font color="#000000" face="Arial"><span style="font-size: 14.6667px; white-space: pre-wrap;"><br></span></font></p><p><font color="#000000" face="Arial"><span style="font-size: 14.6667px; white-space: pre-wrap;"><br></span></font><br><span style="font-size: 14.6667px; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: transparent;">But for every Terribleplanet, there’s a procedurally generated masterpiece that begs you to stay forever and swim through it’s underwater caves with peaceful alien fish. The game also brings a lot of new ideas to the survival genre, which could pay off with a more rewarding storyline and a decent excuse to play for longer than a few hours. <i style="font-size: 14.6667px; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: transparent;">No Man’s Sky </i>does exactly what it says on the tin, but not a whole lot more.</span></p>
