The music and sound effects in The Girl and The Robot simply exist. They never overpower the player, which is a good thing, but they never reach their full potential. The music is nice though for the most part is simply background noise, never intrusive but never really highlighting important moments. The sound effects are very simple, footsteps, mechanical whirring, clanking metal and clashing swords. There’s nothing interesting about them and that’s exactly how it should be. They add to the world and never take away from it. No one will walk away from playing the game with fond memories of how certain elements sounded or how interesting or emotional the soundtrack was but they certainly serve their purpose well within the game.
