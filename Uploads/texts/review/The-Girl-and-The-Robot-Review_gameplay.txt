The gameplay found within The Girl and The Robot is split into two distinct parts, puzzles and combat. The puzzle sections of the game involve the player controlling both The Girl and The Robot to complete various tasks such as opening doors, bypassing enemies and escaping mazes. Each puzzle area is distinctly unique and, while challenging, are never obtuse in their solution.With a little thought each challenge can be overcome relatively easily, Combat makes up the other part of the game and is relatively simple in its execution. Only The Robot can fight, its tools are the sword, the shield and the bow. While the sword and the shield have only a single purpose the bow is often used to trigger certain puzzle elements from a distance. <br>
As for the actual fighting it feels somewhat Dark Souls-esque with the player learning attack patterns, defending when necessary and attacking when the opportunity presents itself. While not very deep it is fun though becomes a little dull as the game progresses.
